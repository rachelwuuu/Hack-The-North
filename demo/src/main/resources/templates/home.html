            <h3>Proper Squat Form:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Stand with feet a little wider than hip width with toes facing forwards.</li>
                <li>Drive your hips back, bend your knees and ankles, and press your knees slightly outwards.</li>
                <li>Sit into a squat position while still keeping your heels and toes on the ground, chest up and shoulders back.</li>
                <li>Aim to reach parallel -- knees are bent to a 90-degree angle, and keep them behind your toes.</li>
                <li>Press into your heels and straighten legs to return to a standing upright position.</li>
              </ol>
